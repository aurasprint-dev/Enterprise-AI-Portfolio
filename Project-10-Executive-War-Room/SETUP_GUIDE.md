- OpenAI API Key  

## 2. Installation  
1. `cd Project-10-Executive-War-Room`  
2. `python -m venv venv`  
3. Activate (Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate` | Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`)  
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

## 3. Configuration  
Ensure your `.env` file contains your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

`python war_room_supervisor.py`  

**How to Pitch This:** Explain to clients that this isn't just a "dashboard"—it is a **reasoning engine** that connects their entire IT ecosystem. If the Security agent finds a breach, the War Room can immediately tell the Finance agent to freeze related accounts and the Legal agent to draft a notice. This is the future of **Autonomous Enterprise Management.** ```

# About Me: IT Consultant & Advisor 🚀

## 🎯 Professional Profile

I am a strategic IT Consultant specialized in bridging the gap between **enterprise business logic** and **autonomous AI systems**. With a focus on the 2026 AI landscape, I help organizations move beyond simple chatbots toward **Agentic Workflows**—systems that don't just "chat," but actually "reason, act, and resolve."

## 🛠️ Core Competencies
- **Agentic Orchestration:** Designing multi-agent ecosystems using **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**.
- **Data Engineering:** Architecting unified enterprise data layers with **Microsoft Fabric** (OneLake/Direct Lake).
- **Hyper-Automation:** Implementing self-healing IT operations using **n8n** and **PydanticAI**.
- **Governance & Security:** Building "Human-in-the-Loop" systems with strict schema validation for financial and security compliance.

## 💡 The Consultant Philosophy
I believe that AI is most valuable when it is **stateful, secure, and structured**. My portfolio demonstrates a three-phased approach to digital transformation:
1.  **Phase 1: Knowledge:** Turning fragmented documents into actionable intelligence (RAG).
2.  **Phase 2: Action:** Automating routine IT and Sales operations via autonomous agents.
3.  **Phase 3: Strategy:** Synthesizing departmental data into executive-level "Strategy War Rooms."

## 📈 2026 Vision
As AI models become commodities, the true value lies in the **Orchestration Layer**. I specialize in building that layer—ensuring that AI agents are grounded in enterprise data, respect corporate boundaries, and deliver measurable ROI.

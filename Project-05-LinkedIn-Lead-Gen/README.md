# Project 5: Autonomous LinkedIn "AI SDR" 🚀
> **Category:** Sales Automation / Growth Engineering

## 💼 Business Use Case
Sales teams spend up to 60% of their day on manual prospecting—finding the right person on LinkedIn, researching their company's recent news, and drafting a message that doesn't look like spam. This project builds an **Agentic Sales Team** that researches a lead and drafts a hyper-personalized outreach message based on real-time web data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** CrewAI
- **Search Tool:** Serper.dev (Google Search API) or Exa.ai
- **Scraping:** Firecrawl or BeautifulSoup
- **Model:** GPT-4o-mini (Optimized for high-volume research)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (The "Sales Crew")
1. **The Lead Researcher:** Scours the web for the prospect's recent LinkedIn posts, company press releases, and career history.
2. **The Personalization Specialist:** Analyzes the research to find a "hook" (e.g., a recent award or a shared technical challenge).
3. **The Ghostwriter:** Drafts a concise, value-driven LinkedIn connection request or email.

## 🎯 Consultant's Strategic Impact
- **Efficiency:** Turns a 20-minute manual research task into a 30-second automated process.
- **Higher Conversion:** Personalization increases response rates by 3x-5x compared to generic templates.
- **Scalability:** Allows a small sales team to act like a large enterprise department by automating the "top-of-funnel" research.
